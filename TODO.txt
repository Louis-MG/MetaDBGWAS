The next steps of this project are the following :

- write the wiki to explain the different steps in details
- see if I can add the program to conda with a yaml file

Furthermore :

- change the input file with the info of each file to add a column with the approximate genome size, thus allowing for a run of Lighter with different parameters when needed instead f the unique one we have right now
- change the way lighter is used to accomodate for the above modification
- parallelize the load for Lighter and others if more than a threshold of threads given ?
