The next steps of this project are the following :

- write the wiki to explain the different steps in details
- see if I can add the program to conda with a yaml file

Furthermore :

- remove Lighter from the pipeline and change it eventually for Rcorrector or make a new tool
- parallelize the load for Lighter and others if more than a threshold of threads given ?
